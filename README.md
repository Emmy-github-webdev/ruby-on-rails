# Ruby on Rails

> Learn Ruby on Rails from scratch.


## Built With

- Ruby

## Getting Started

- You will need to have Ruby installed.

- Clone this repo [Ruby on Rails](https://github.com/Emmy-github-webdev/ruby-on-rails).

## Run Ruby on Rails

- cd the directory
- Run rails server

## Things to be cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation
> Create Table
- articles table
1 - Run rails generate migration create_articles
2 - Go to the migrate folder in db and add the neccessary filed (t.string :title t.text :description)
3 - Run rails db:migrate
4 - check the schema file and be sure the table is created

> Drop a table if there is a mistake
1 - Run rails db:rollback
2 - Update the table and repeat the step 3 in Create table
> Alternatively, this is the best approach than dropping the table
1 - Run rails generate migration add_description_to_articles. This will generate a new migration file
2 - In the new migration file, add the missing fileds e.g
add_column :articles, :description, :text
add_column :articles, :created_at, :datetime
add_column :articles, :updated_at, :datetime
3 - Run rails db:migrate

> Create Model
1. Right click the model folder and create a file article.rb
2. In the article.rb add the class
class Article < ActiveRecord::Base

end
3. On the CMD run rails console
4. Check the article connection: Article.all
5. Run Articles - It should display are the fileds in the db
6. Instantiate the article - article = Article.new
7. User setter to create new article - article.title = "Title one" enter, article.description = "Article description" enter
8. Run article - This will display your created article
9. Run article.save - To save the data
10. Article.all
> Alternatively, all of these can be done in one line of code
* article = Article.new(title: "Title two", description: "Description two")
* article.save

> The 3rd option - This create and save directly to the databse
* Article.create(title: "Title two", description: "Description two")


> Note: Following the casing

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions
